MINIX 3 is a UNIX-like operating system created with the goal of being a highly reliable and self-healing microkernel OS. MINIX 3 includes ssh, emacs, vi, perl, python, bash, X11, ftp, pine, clang, and gnu tools. Updated binary and source application packages are available for MINIX 3. MINIX 3 is available under a BSD license and supports many programming languages.

WinMinix makes setting up, experimenting, and developing on MINIX from Windows easy.

[Archived Releases](https://github.com/sirredbeard/WinMinix/releases)

**Installation steps:**
* Download and unzip a [.ZIP](https://github.com/sirredbeard/WinMinix/archive/master.zip) archive of this repo.
* Run GetMINIX.bat to download MINIX cd image.
* Run InstallMINIX.bat to install MINIX onto built-in virtual hard-drive
    * Select option 1 in the boot menu
    * Login as 'root', no password is required
    * Type setup at the shell
    * Follow the prompts, you can usually accept all defaults unless you have made specific customizations
    * Back at shell, type shutdown -h now, and close window when it indicates it is safe to do so.
* Run WinMINIX.bat to boot freshly installed MINIX

**Post-installation:**
* Consult [post installation documentation](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=usersguide:postinstallation) for MINIX, including installing binary packages using [pkgin](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=usersguide:installingbinarypackages) or from source using NetBSD's [pkgsrc](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=usersguide:installingsourcepackages) repo..

**Hacking this project:**
* See the "Examples" folder:
   * Use WinMinix-X11.bat with settings optimized for X11, but note it creates an additional window.
   * Use WinMinix-sshd.bat to launch a headless MINIX instance ssh pass-through via localhost:2200. Note: sshd must be properly 
configured on MINIX first. See [sshd documentation](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=usersguide:settingupssh).
   * Remember to copy your edited .bat file out up Examples up to the base WinMinix folder.
* Optimize QEMU for your particular hardware by tweaking command-line settings in WinMINIX.bat.
* Fork this project and replace MINIX with another obscure operating system.
    1. Fork this project.
    2. Replace link to MINIX ISO in GetMINIX.bat with your own ISO link. Unarchive with 7za if needed.
    3. Edit filename of ISO in InstallMINIX.bat and WinMINIX.bat to your newly downlaoded ISO.
    4. Rename .bat files, e.g. WinHAIKU.bat, as preferred.
* Add a reliable way to perform SHA1 verification on downloads.
